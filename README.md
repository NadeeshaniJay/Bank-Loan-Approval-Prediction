• Project Title:  Bank Loan Approval Prediction

• Introduction:

Predicting bank loan approvals accurately is essential for maximizing resources, lowering risk, and guaranteeing customer satisfaction. By streamlining the procedure and enabling banks to quickly identify applicants, machine learning models improve operational effectiveness and conform to responsible lending standards.

• Defining the ML problem:

a. Task: Determining a customer's likelihood of being approved for a bank loan.

b. Experience: The project makes use of a financial dataset that includes consumer details like income, age, and credit card activity. By reading patterns and insights from past documentation, the machine learning algorithm uses this data to predict loan approval.

c. Performance Measure: The evaluation of a model evaluates its recall, accuracy, precision, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. By weighing true and false results, these metrics assess how well the algorithm categorizes consumers for loan acceptance.

• Data:

a. Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikramamin/bank-loan-approval-lr-dt-rfand-auc/

b. Features: Including customer attributes such as Age, Income, Experience, Education, Family size, Credit Card, Personal Loan, etc. Total of 11 features.

c. Number of Examples: 5000

d. Missing Data Handling: There is no missing data.

• Algorithm:

a. Selected Algorithms:

            • Logistic Regression
            
            • Decision Tree
            
b. Availability of Algorithms:

            • In Python, there are two widely used libraries for implementing logistic regression and decision tree algorithms. They are scikit-learn and statsmodels.
